git rm -f NameOfFile 		-> remove file from staging area


git remote -v 				-> show connection
git remote add origin Repo_Url      -> connect local repo to GitHub repo


git push -u origin main   	-> push branch to GitHub for the first time & set upstream
git push origin main      	-> push new commits (after upstream is set)
git push  					-> Push changes

git push origin --delete feature1   -> Delete remote branch

git fetch                   -> Get remote updates (no merge)
git pull                    -> Fetch + merge
git pull --rebase           -> Fetch + rebase (cleaner history)


git tag                   	-> list all tags

git show v1.1             	-> show details about the tag and its commit(author, date, commit)





git clone <repo-url>      	-> download a GitHub repo to your computer




git branch                	-> list branches (current branch marked with *)
git branch BranchName		-> Make new Branch 
git branch -d feature2    	-> delete a local branch
git branch -D BranchName    -> Force delete local branch
git branch --all          	-> list local and remote branches
git branch -m new-name      -> Rename current branch

git checkout BranchName      # Switch to branch (old style)
git checkout -b feature1  	-> create and switch to new branch
git checkout 3a5de3d		-> travel for this commit ( the head be there )

git switch main           	-> switch to main branch
git switch -c feature2    	-> same as above (newer command)
git switch -              	-> switch back to previous branch(dash means "previous")



git diff > file.patch 		-> save your changes into a patch file that can be shared or applied later
git apply file.patch 		-> apply the changes from a patch file to your working directory




git push origin feature1  	-> push branch feature1 to GitHub
git merge feature1        	-> merge feature1 branch into current branch (e.g., main) keep the graph like it was and connect the last commit of branch with main


git rebase feature3		    -> reapply the commits of current branch on top of feature3 branch connect all commit from branch above of main , the graph look one line


CONFLICT			        -> when the same file is modified in two branches and you try to merge or rebase; Git stops and asks you to manually choose which changes to keep
